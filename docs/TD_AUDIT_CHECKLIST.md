# Technical Director Audit Checklist

1. Reproducibility: fresh clone build succeeds end-to-end
2. Schema/runtime contract: v16 damage types, status effects, and signature weapons consume cleanly
3. Release hygiene: release zip generation and file-count gate pass
4. Content integrity: validate ownership and references for launch entities
