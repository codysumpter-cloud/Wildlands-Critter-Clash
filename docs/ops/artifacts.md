# Artifact Classes (Behavior Separation)

## Class A — Deterministic / Source-of-Truth (Model B)
These are versioned, generated outputs that directly impact gameplay correctness.

- `data/generated/**`
- `runtime/manifest.json`
- `runtime/weapons.json`
- `runtime/damage_types.json`
- `runtime/status_effects.json`

### CI Contract
- Generated by: `npm run build:all`
- Enforced by scoped deterministic diff guard in CI.

## Class B — Playable Payload
These are web-delivery artifacts used for playtesting and itch packaging.

- `index.html`
- `game_bundle.js`
- `data_bundle.js`
- stylesheets
- `assets/**`
- additional runtime payload files

### CI Contract
- Versioned for now at repo root.
- Not included in deterministic diff enforcement.
- Packaged by: `npm run release:itch`

## Future Migration (Planned)
After 1-2 stable cycles, move payload artifacts into `/playable/` to reduce root clutter and enable cleaner CI path scoping.
